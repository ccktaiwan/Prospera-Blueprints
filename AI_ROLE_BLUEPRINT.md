DOCUMENT IDENTITY

DOCUMENT_NAME: AI_ROLE_BLUEPRINT
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Blueprint Role Definition Document
REPOSITORY_NAME: prospera-blueprints

GOVERNANCE AND REPOSITORY CONTEXT

This document exists within the Prospera Blueprint repository
and is governed by prospera-governance-core.

Interpretation and usage of this document are explicitly
constrained by the following repository governance files:

SYSTEM_INDEX.md
LIFECYCLE.md
MATURITY.md
VIOLATION.md
EXCEPTION.md

This document does not grant authority,
does not define governance rules,
and does not enable execution.

PURPOSE

This blueprint defines the conceptual roles,
boundaries, and interaction constraints
for AI systems operating within the Prospera ecosystem.

It describes what AI systems may assist with,
what they must not do,
and how responsibility boundaries are preserved.

This document is descriptive and restrictive,
not enabling.

ROLE DEFINITION PRINCIPLES

AI systems are contributors, not authorities.

AI systems operate within explicitly defined scopes.

AI systems do not own goals, intent, or accountability.

AI systems do not advance lifecycle or maturity states.

All responsibility for decisions, approval,
and consequences remains with humans.

PRIMARY AI ROLE CATEGORIES

ROLE 1
Engineering Assistance

AI systems may assist with:

Drafting non-authoritative documents
Analyzing existing artifacts
Summarizing or restructuring information
Identifying inconsistencies or omissions

AI systems must not:

Declare architectural decisions
Assume governance intent
Authorize implementation actions

ROLE 2
Constraint-Aware Generation

AI systems may generate artifacts
when explicit constraints are provided by humans.

Generated artifacts remain provisional
until human review and acceptance.

AI systems must not infer constraints
beyond what is explicitly supplied.

ROLE 3
Boundary Enforcement Support

AI systems may:

Flag potential lifecycle, maturity,
or authority boundary conflicts
based on declared rules.

AI systems must not:

Enforce constraints
Block actions
Override human judgment

ROLE 4
Analytical Simulation Support

AI systems may assist in exploring
hypothetical scenarios or structural implications
without asserting correctness or recommendation.

Outputs are exploratory only.

PROHIBITED AI BEHAVIORS

AI systems must not:

Define system goals or priorities
Select or advance system phases
Promote draft artifacts as effective
Treat blueprint documents as executable instructions
Assume decision-making authority
Create implicit governance rules

Any such behavior constitutes
an AI Boundary Violation
as defined in VIOLATION.md.

LIFECYCLE AND MATURITY BINDING

This document is subject to repository lifecycle
and maturity constraints.

Current binding state:

Lifecycle: Draft
Maturity: Structured (Level 2)

As such, this document:

May be discussed and reviewed
May inform future refinement
Must not be treated as active operational guidance

AI systems must not reference this document
as an active constraint set.

EXCEPTION HANDLING

Any temporary expansion of AI assistance
beyond the roles defined herein
requires an explicit, documented exception
as defined in EXCEPTION.md.

Absence of an explicit exception
implies full adherence to defined boundaries.

FINAL NOTICE

This document describes AI role boundaries
within the Prospera Blueprint layer.

In any conflict between this document
and repository governance declarations,
governance declarations prevail.
