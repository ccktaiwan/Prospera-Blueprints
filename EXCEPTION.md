GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIP

This repository operates under the governance authority
of prospera-governance-core.

Exceptions described in this document do not create
new authority, permissions, or execution rights.

This document exists to define how limited deviations
from declared constraints may be temporarily recognized
without altering governance rules.

PURPOSE

This document defines the exception handling model
for the Prospera Blueprint repository.

It clarifies:

When deviations from lifecycle or maturity constraints
may be temporarily tolerated
How exceptions are scoped, documented, and reviewed
How exceptions differ from violations
How exceptions expire or are resolved

Exceptions are intentional deviations, not errors.

EXCEPTION PRINCIPLES

Exceptions are explicit and time-bounded.

Exceptions are contextual and non-transferable.

Exceptions do not redefine governance rules,
lifecycle stages, or maturity levels.

Exceptions do not become precedents by default.

Absence of an explicit exception implies
full adherence to declared constraints.

EXCEPTION CATEGORIES

CATEGORY 1
Lifecycle Exception

A temporary allowance to reference a blueprint artifact
outside its declared lifecycle stage
for analysis, comparison, or controlled exploration.

CATEGORY 2
Maturity Exception

A temporary allowance to reference a blueprint artifact
beyond its declared maturity level
with explicit acknowledgement of uncertainty.

CATEGORY 3
Traversal Exception

A temporary allowance to access non-indexed content
for investigative or transitional purposes
without conferring authority.

CATEGORY 4
AI Assistance Exception

A narrowly scoped allowance for AI systems
to assist beyond normal drafting or analysis roles
under explicit human supervision.

EXCEPTION REQUIREMENTS

Any exception must be:

Explicitly documented
Human-initiated
Contextually justified
Time-bounded
Traceable via commit history or written record

Undocumented exceptions are invalid.

AI systems must not initiate, infer,
or extend exceptions.

EXCEPTION VS VIOLATION

An exception is declared before or during usage
with awareness and intent.

A violation is identified after non-aligned usage
without declared exception.

An exception does not negate the existence
of a violation outside its declared scope.

RESOLUTION AND EXPIRATION

All exceptions must have one of the following outcomes:

Expiration with no further action
Conversion into compliant usage
Escalation for governance review

Expired exceptions automatically revert
to standard constraint enforcement.

FINAL DECLARATION

This document defines how exceptions are recognized
within prospera-blueprints.

It does not grant authority.
It does not enable execution.
It does not modify governance rules.
