GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIP

This repository operates under the governance authority
of prospera-governance-core.

Violation definitions in this document do not constitute
enforcement actions, penalties, or remediation orders.

This document exists to describe conditions under which
usage or interpretation of blueprint artifacts
is considered non-compliant with declared constraints.

PURPOSE

This document defines what constitutes a violation
within the context of the Prospera Blueprint repository.

It aims to:

Prevent misinterpretation of blueprint artifacts
Prevent premature or unauthorized execution usage
Clarify boundary breaches between governance, blueprint,
and execution layers
Provide a common vocabulary for identifying misuse

This document is descriptive, not punitive.

VIOLATION PRINCIPLES

A violation describes a state of non-alignment,
not an assignment of blame.

Violations do not automatically trigger enforcement,
suspension, or correction.

Violations must be explicitly identified,
contextualized, and reviewed by humans.

Absence of malicious intent does not negate a violation.

Presence of a violation does not imply system failure.

VIOLATION CATEGORIES

CATEGORY 1
Lifecycle Violation

Occurs when a blueprint artifact is used
in a manner inconsistent with its declared lifecycle stage.

Examples include:

Using Draft-stage artifacts as execution input
Referencing non-accepted artifacts as binding structure

CATEGORY 2
Maturity Violation

Occurs when a blueprint artifact is relied upon
beyond its declared maturity level.

Examples include:

Treating conceptual artifacts as stable references
Assuming validated reliability without evidence

CATEGORY 3
Authority Boundary Violation

Occurs when blueprint artifacts are treated as
governance authority or execution directives.

Examples include:

Deriving policy decisions from blueprint documents
Treating architectural descriptions as mandatory rules

CATEGORY 4
Traversal Violation

Occurs when repository content is accessed or interpreted
without following declared traversal order.

Examples include:

Referencing non-indexed documents as authoritative
Bypassing SYSTEM_INDEX.md

CATEGORY 5
AI Boundary Violation

Occurs when AI systems exceed their permitted role.

Examples include:

Inferring missing constraints or intent
Advancing lifecycle or maturity states
Treating blueprint artifacts as executable instructions

DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION

Violations may be identified through:

Human review
Cross-repository inconsistency
Explicit reporting
Governance review processes

Automated detection may assist
but does not determine violation status.

HANDLING OF VIOLATIONS

Handling a violation may include:

Documentation of the issue
Contextual clarification
Temporary restriction of usage
Escalation to governance review

No automatic enforcement is implied by this document.

MISINTERPRETATION PREVENTION

Violation identification must not be used as:

A substitute for governance authority
An enforcement mechanism
A punitive tool

This document defines recognition, not response.

FINAL DECLARATION

This document defines how violations are identified
within prospera-blueprints.

It does not authorize enforcement.
It does not prescribe remediation.
It does not override governance processes.
