ENGINEERING PURPOSE AND ARCHITECTURAL ROLE

This document declares the resolved, binding, and authoritative governance 
state of the Prospera Blueprints repository. 

As the primary repository for the Layer 2 (Blueprint) domain, this artifact 
is responsible for the architectural translation of Layer 1 Governance 
Intent into Layer 3 Execution Specifications. It defines the deterministic 
boundaries, interaction contracts, and responsibility allocation required 
to prevent implementation leakage and ensure that all execution remains 
subordinate to governed intent.

────────────────────────────────

AUTHORITY VECTOR AND BINDING POSTURE (RESOLVED)

| Authority Vector (Resolved)   | Status | Binding Effect                         |
| :--------------------------- | :----: | :------------------------------------- |
| Arch. Boundary Authority     |  YES   | Mandatory Global Design Constraint     |
| Interaction Contract Auth.    |  YES   | Enforceable via Schema & Logic Gates   |
| Translation Responsibility   |  YES   | L1 Intent to L3 Execution Mapping      |
| Governance Rule-Making       |  NO    | Subordinate to L1 Mind/Spine           |
| Runtime Implementation       |  NO    | EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED                  |

This vector establishes that L2 owns the *structure of interaction*, while L1 
owns the *rules of authority* and L3 owns the *realization of action*.

PHASE DETERMINATION AND TRANSITION CRITERIA

Current Engineering Phase: 
PHASE 2 — ARCHITECTURE AND BOUNDARY DEFINITION

Phase 2 Exit Criteria (Mandatory):
1. INTERACTION LOCK: 
   All cross-layer interaction models (L1-L2, L2-L3) must be explicitly 
   modeled and validated against L1 invariants.
2. BOUNDARY RESOLUTION: 
   Definition of all component domains must be complete, ensuring zero 
   functional overlap between L3 execution modules.
3. SSOT ALIGNMENT: 
   The Blueprint must be indexed and referenced by the Global System 
   Index (MND-L1-SYS-INDEX).

────────────────────────────────

ARCHITECTURAL INTERACTION AXIOMS (L2 SPECIFIC)

Axiom L2-01: Deterministic Translation
Every blueprint artifact must be a deterministic projection of an upstream 
L1 governance rule. Blueprints do not 'create' authority; they 'channel' it.

Axiom L2-02: Implementation Agnosticism
Blueprints define 'what' must be achieved and 'where' the boundaries lie. 
They remain agnostic of 'how' the execution layer implements the logic, 
provided implementation does not violate the L2 boundary.

Axiom L2-03: Responsibility Isolation
L2 is the final layer where design intent is articulated. Any failure 
in L3 execution that results from an ambiguous L2 blueprint is classified 
as a Layer 2 Governance Failure.

────────────────────────────────

CROSS-REPOSITORY DEPENDENCY AND REFERENCE CLOSURE

Upstream Authority Binding:
- Prospera-Governance-Core (MND-L1-STAT-001)
- prospera-kernel-codex (MND-L1-STAT-002)
- prospera-engineering-codex (SPN-L1-STAT-003)

Downstream Constraint Binding:
- All Layer 3 Execution Repositories (Execution class)
- All Layer 3 Generation Repositories (Generation class)

Any blueprint or interaction contract that contradicts L1 constitutional 
invariants is invalid by definition and must trigger a Phase 0 Re-Lock.

────────────────────────────────

CHANGE CONTROL AND AMENDMENT PROTOCOL

This governance state is ACTIVE but transitioning. Any modification to 
interaction contracts, boundary definitions, or responsibility allocation 
requires a formal review by the Prospera Engineering Governance Council. 
Unilateral modification of L2 blueprints by L3 implementers is a 
critical system violation.

────────────────────────────────

WRITING STANDARD AND DEPTH (PATENT-SAFE L2)

Writing Depth Standard: 
Architectural-Declarative (Level 2). 

Constraint Notice: 
This repository establishes the 'Blueprint Fence'. It defines the 
architectural specifications for implementation but contains zero runtime 
source code, algorithmic implementation, or executable automation. 
This depth is strictly maintained to ensure that human-governed design 
is legally and technically isolated from AI-generated execution, 
preserving the human-only decision chain required for patent integrity.
