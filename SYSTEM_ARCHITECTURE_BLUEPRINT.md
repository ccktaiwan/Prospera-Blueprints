GOVERNANCE AND REPOSITORY CONTEXT

This document exists within the Prospera Blueprint repository
and is governed by prospera-governance-core.

Interpretation and usage of this document are explicitly
constrained by the following repository-level governance
documents:

SYSTEM_INDEX.md
LIFECYCLE.md
MATURITY.md
VIOLATION.md
EXCEPTION.md

This document does not define authority, governance rules,
or execution permissions.

Its content is architectural description only
and is subject to repository lifecycle and maturity constraints.

CURRENT GOVERNANCE BINDING STATE

Lifecycle Binding:
Draft

As defined in LIFECYCLE.md, artifacts in Draft stage:

Are exploratory
Are non-binding
Must not be used as execution input
Must not be treated as active architectural constraints

Maturity Binding:
Structured (Level 2)

As defined in MATURITY.md, artifacts at this level:

Define structure and boundaries
May be discussed for architectural reasoning
Must not be assumed stable or validated

Violation Sensitivity:
High

Any use of this document as:

Execution guidance
Implementation directive
Governance reference

without explicit lifecycle advancement
constitutes a violation as defined in VIOLATION.md.

Exception Eligibility:
Conditional

Any temporary deviation in usage of this document
must be explicitly documented as an exception
in accordance with EXCEPTION.md.

ABSENCE OF IMPLICIT EFFECTIVENESS

Presence of this document does not imply:

Acceptance
Activation
Authorization
Stability

Effectiveness is derived only from
explicit lifecycle and maturity advancement
documented elsewhere.

AI INTERACTION CONSTRAINTS

AI systems may assist in analysis or drafting
based on this document.

AI systems must not:

Assume architectural authority
Infer missing constraints
Treat this document as executable or binding
Advance lifecycle or maturity state

All AI-assisted usage remains subject
to human interpretation and governance review.

SCOPE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document describes the high-level
structural architecture of the Prospera system,
including conceptual domains and boundary intent.

It is intended to serve as an input
for future architectural alignment discussions
once lifecycle and maturity conditions permit.

FINAL NOTICE

This document is explicitly subordinate
to repository governance declarations.

Any conflict between this document
and repository governance files
must be resolved in favor of governance files.
