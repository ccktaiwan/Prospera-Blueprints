REPOSITORY ROLE DECLARATION

This repository is the Blueprint Layer of the Prospera ecosystem.

It defines system architecture, component boundaries,
responsibility allocation, and translation contracts
between governance intent and execution systems.

This repository does NOT define governance authority
and does NOT implement execution logic.

It is a non-executable, architecture-only repository.

GOVERNANCE ALIGNMENT

This repository is governed by:

prospera-governance-core

All documents, structures, and changes within this repository
MUST comply with governance rules, authority boundaries,
and system phase constraints defined in prospera-governance-core.

This repository holds no independent authority.

AUTHORITY STATEMENT

This repository is authoritative only within
the Blueprint Layer.

It MAY define:

System architecture boundaries
Component responsibility domains
Execution translation constraints
Inter-repository interaction models

It MUST NOT define:

Governance rules or policies
Runtime behavior or workflows
Operational procedures
Tooling, automation, or executable artifacts

CANONICAL ENTRY POINT

SYSTEM_INDEX.md is the sole canonical entry point
for this repository.

All traversal, interpretation, and usage
of this repository MUST begin here.

Any document or directory not explicitly referenced
by this index is non-authoritative by definition.

BLUEPRINT DOMAINS

The following blueprint domains are defined
within this repository.

DOMAIN 1
System Architecture Blueprint

Defines the overall Prospera system structure,
architectural domains, and authority flow.

Authoritative location:

SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md

DOMAIN 2
AI Role & Boundary Blueprint

Defines AI role confinement, responsibility boundaries,
and non-authoritative operational limits.

Authoritative location:

AI_ROLE_BLUEPRINT.md

DOMAIN 3
Repository Interaction Blueprint

Defines interaction contracts between
Blueprint, Execution, and Reference repositories.

Authoritative location:

REPOSITORY_INTERACTION_BLUEPRINT.md

REPOSITORY TRAVERSAL RULES

Traversal order is strictly enforced:

1. SYSTEM_INDEX.md
2. Blueprint domain documents referenced herein

Any deviation from this order
constitutes a blueprint violation.

AI AND AUTOMATION NOTICE

AI systems interacting with this repository:

May assist in drafting or analysis
Must NOT define authority or architecture
Must NOT infer missing governance intent
Must respect declared lifecycle and maturity state

CHANGE CONTROL NOTICE

This repository is governance-governed.

All structural or architectural changes
require explicit review for governance alignment.

Silent changes, inferred extensions,
or scope creep are prohibited.

FINAL DECLARATION

of the Prospera ecosystem.
